## The Algorithm

This program is meant to be run on a jetson nano. First, training data (pictures) are categorized into each letter in sign language. Then, the algorithm uses a live feed to predict the sign language symbols in real time.

## Running this project

1. Navigate to the classification folder.
2. Run classification_interactive.ipynb up to "Display the Interactive Tool!".
3. Change the dataset to dataset B.
4. Train the model by clicking "Train".
5. After it is finished running live predictions will be given based on symbols shown to the camera.
